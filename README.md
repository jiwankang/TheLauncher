# The Launcher
The Launcher was created as a lockscreen replacement which allowed for easy access to phone apps using custom gestures.
Instead of using the regular lockscreen, users unlock to see The Launcher's lockscreen, where the custom gestures preconfigured in the settings would be in effect.
This project was built for EngHack, a Hackathon held at the University of Waterloo.

## Status
The main obstacle we faced was disabling the home button for the lock screen, allowing any user to bypass the lockscreen by closing the app.
Currently, a way to create new gestures is needed, the main app needs to be hidden, and there should be a way to disable this lockscreen.
This project is not currently in development.
